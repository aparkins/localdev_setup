== LOCALDEV SETUP SCRIPT

This is intended to get me from zero to fully setup localdev configuration so I don't have to keep doing this every time I have to work on a new machine.

This pretends to support linux and OSX, but realistically only OSX has any serious development. Sorry Ubuntu :(

== PRELIMINARY SETUP

Before this can begin, you need to install Homebrew and Git (to clone the repository). Once that's done, though, you should be ready to just run the relevant `install.sh` script.
