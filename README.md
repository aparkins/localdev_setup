== LOCALDEV SETUP SCRIPT

This is intended to get me from zero to fully setup localdev configuration so I don't have to keep doing this every time I have to work on a new machine.

Currently two supported systems: Ubuntu and OS X. They're very nearly the same, but a few subtle differences (hence distinct installation steps).
